        As well as the required :attr:`probability` parameter, the type of

        to which the skew is performed.
        To see examples of the various skews, see :ref:`perspectiveskewing`.
        Images are skewed **in place** and an image of the same size is
        returned by this function. That is to say, that after a skew
        has been performed, the largest possible area of the same aspect ratio
        of the original image is cropped from the skewed image, and this is
        then resized to match the original image size. The

         ``TILT_LEFT_RIGHT``, or ``CORNER``.
         - ``TILT`` will randomly skew either left, right, up, or down.
           Left or right means it skews on the x-axis while up and down
           means that it skews on the y-axis.
         - ``TILT_TOP_BOTTOM`` will randomly skew up or down, or in other
           words skew along the y-axis.
         - ``TILT_LEFT_RIGHT`` will randomly skew left or right, or in other
           words skew along the x-axis.

           along the x-axis or y-axis. This means in one of 8 different
